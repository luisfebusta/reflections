    need to inform git to start tracking the repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	working directory contails all files, repository contains all committed files
	staging area contains a subset of all files to be added to the repossitory in a commit. It adds flexibility.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

    add only files included in logical change and commit.
